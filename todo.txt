1. Move from each note = each file to all notes = single file architecture
2. Improve performance by creating an index file.
Currently, all notes are loaded on every page load and on each note create/update/delete operation.
To optimize this, create an index.json file that stores only note metadata or indexes.
On page load or note changes, load only this index file instead of all note contents

This probably solves issues with slow speed on mobile.
